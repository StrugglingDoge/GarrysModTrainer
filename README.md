# GarrysModTrainer
This was worked on back in November of 2018. I was experimenting with certain games 
trying to find memory addresses and trying to make a simple trainer. These offsets
may not work anymore. If not, you'll have to find your own offsets and update them.
Bhop is the only thing I got working.
